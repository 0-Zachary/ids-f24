# Communication in Data Science

This chapter was written by Sara Clokey.

## Introduction

Hi! My name is Sara, and I am a junior double majoring in Applied Data 
Analysis and Communication. The topic of my presentation today, 
Communication in Data Science, combines my academic and professional
interests while underscoring the importance of 'soft skills' like public
speaking, for example, within STEM fields like data science.

## Importance & Application of Communication
Data science as an career path has exploded witihn the last decade. Some 
fields that offer data science positions include:
        - Finance
        - Healthcare
        - Media production
        - Sports
        - Banking
        - Insurance
        - E-Commerce
        - Energy
        - Manufacturing
        - Transportation
        - Construction

Because data science is applicable in so many industries, it is essential that
data scientists have the skills and experience to communicate their work with
others who do not have the same technical education. 

Within these industries, collaboration and teammwork are oftan at the forefront.
Inexperience with data should not prevent your colleagues from being able to
contribute to shared projects, and strong communication skills can mitigate 
this possibility!
