# Communication in Data Science

This chapter was written by Sara Clokey.

## Introduction

Hi! My name is Sara, and I am a junior double majoring in Applied Data 
Analysis and Communication. The topic of my presentation today, 
Communication in Data Science, combines my academic and professional
interests while underscoring the importance of 'soft skills' like public
speaking, for example, within STEM fields like data science.

## Importance & Application of Communication
Data science as an career path has exploded witihn the last decade. Some 
fields that offer data science positions include:
        - Finance
        - Healthcare
        - Media production
        - Sports
        - Banking
        - Insurance
        - E-Commerce
        - Energy
        - Manufacturing
        - Transportation
        - Construction

Because data science is applicable in so many industries, it is essential that
data scientists have the skills and experience to communicate their work with
others who do not have the same technical education. 

Within these industries, collaboration and teammwork are oftan at the forefront.
Inexperience with data should not prevent your colleagues from being able to
contribute to shared projects, and strong communication skills can mitigate 
this possibility!

## General Communication Skills

### Verbal Communication Skills

Verbal Communication: "the use of sounds and language to
relay a message" (Fer, 2018)

Verbal Communication Tips
        - Make a good first impression
        - Use appropriate language (jargon, metaphors)
        - Prioritize brevity
        - Practice beforehand
        - Give room for questions

### Non-Verbal Communication Skills

Non-Verbal Communication: "aspects of communication other than spoken or 
written words, including elements such as tone, pitch, and body language, 
which significantly influence how messages are perceived" (James, 2024)

Non-Verbal Communication Tips
        - Utilize vocal variety (pitch, rate, volume)
        - Avoid distracting hand and body movement
        - Make eye contact
        - Pay attention to proxemics

### Visual Communication Skills

Visual Communication: "any communication that employs oneâ€™s sense of 
sight to deliver a message without the usage of any verbal cues" (Fayaz, 2022)

Visual Communication Tips
        - Center clarity above all else
        - Ensure proper labeling and scaling
        - Create visual contrast (colors, shape, font)
        - Choose the most appropriate visual

### Written Communication Skills

Written Communication: "the exchange of ideas and information through written
words, a structured and permanent form of communication, often used in formal
and professional settings" (James, 2024)

Written Communication Tips
        - Clearly state goal with thesis statement
        - Prioritize professionalism (contractions, slang)
        - Proofread and utilize peer editing
        - Follow specific structure
        - Balance concision with analysis

## Communication in Data Science

Oftentimes as data scientists, you will be charged with communicating "technical
conclusions to non-technical members"; this may be colleagues in other
departments, like marketing, or supervisors at the managerial level. Here are some
tips for effectively communicating project results specifically in the field of
data science.

### Identify your Audience
Who are you sharing information with? Is it a room of data scientists like this
one? Is it full of students who want to learn about data science? Is it a group
of executives looking to make a funding decision?
        - Consider the context and prior knowledge (technical jargon)
        - Consider the motivation for listening

### Utilize Data Visualization
One of the most effective methods of communicating results in data science,
especially to those without technical coding knowledge,
is data visualization techniques. Python uses the package matplotlib to produce
these visualizations, including:
        - line plots
        - bar plots
        - box plots
        - histograms
        - heat maps
        - pie charts

These visualizations allow for complex statistical projects to be simplified 
into a single graphic, which centers the focus on project results and implications
rather than methodology. As with verbal communication, ensure that data 
visualization techniques are free of technical jargon and clearly label all 
aspects of the visual.

### Focus on  Data Communication Skills
The following skill sets highlight more technical data communication that will
be more common within projects and shared with other data scientists to communicate
about your data.
        - Coding communication: Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, SQL
        - Analysis communication: creating a storyline, descriptive versus 
        diagnostic versus predictive analytics, problem identification
        - Data management: collection, cleaning/transformation, storage
        - Data visualization

### Give Space for Questions and Feedback
Within professional spaces, it is essential for data scientists to provide time 
for their clients, supervisors, and colleagues to ask questions about their
work and subsequent findings. 
        - Pause and give room for questions throughout the presentation
        - Offer contact information for continued collaboration
        - Schedule follow-ups if necessary

Teamwork is often at the heart of data science projects within industries, and 
open communication makes this teamwork run much more smoothly.
